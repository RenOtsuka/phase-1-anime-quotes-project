## Overview

Upon loading the page the home screen looks like this
where there are five buttons to interact with, all labeled

![Home Screen](./readme_img/home_screen.png)

</br>

Clicking either or both the first two buttons will toggle the forms to show/hide, giving the user the ability to search for quotes based on the name of the anime or a character

![Forms](./readme_img/forms_screen.png)

</br>

The below images shows what using the title and character forms respectively

![UsingTitle](./readme_img/using_title_form.png)

![UsingChar](./readme_img/using_char_form.png)

<br>

The third button will display ten random quotes from the API each time the button is clicked

The fourth button will display a random quote each time the button is clicked (Displaying ten quotes looks similar to this)

The last button will display all available anime that is in the database of the API (Not limited to what's displayed in the screenshot)
